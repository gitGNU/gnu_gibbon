- Do not return NULL from constructor of GibbonCairoboard in case the 
  constructor fails.
- Are esacped values in SGF files passed through?
- Remove all traces of backgammon from gsgf.h.
- Better formatting of libgsgf output.
- Check that write_stream methods do not leak memory (pointer to
  temporary buffer must be freed, or alloca() must be used).
- Trade memory for performance: Avoid NULL pointers in gsgf-flavor.c.
- No need to check for single value in the new_from_raw constructors
  of libgsgf.  This is already done by the constraints.  Alternatively,
  gratuitous values could be discarded.
- Refactor set_value() method of GSGFText.  It must be possible to
  return an error.
- Remove the constructs if (*error) *error = NULL; fix caller instead.
- Make archive directory configurable.
- gsgf_node_get_property_cooked() must return a GSGFValue and should therefore
  be renamed.
- When setting the value of a GSGFProperty, that property must be
  automatically cooked.
- Decide on a philosophy for adding components in libgsgf.  Either always
  increase the reference count and leave the added object to the caller
  or always hijack the object.
- Go through gsgf-private.h and remove what is not needed.  Turn the rest
  into private class methods.
- Order header functions in libgsgf headers.
- GSGFSimpleText does not allow newlines.  Enforce that restriction.
  For example, gsgf_game_tree_set_application() must be changed
  accordingly.
- Check whether the player list context menu can be created with glade.
  Before 3.5.4 it was always converted to a GtkAction.
- Change svg-util.c to not switch locale.  Instead fix libsvg to
  use the g_ascii_strto...() functions from glib.
- Password gets lost if not saved in preferences.  Use a temporary
  buffer for it.
- Cancelling a connection attempt probably has a race.  The connector
  object gets unreffed before it can check its state.  FIX: Temporarily
  keep a reference.
- Get rid of GibbonSignal, it's pretty useless.
- gibbon-session.c leaks memory in case of board errors; pos must be freed!
- gibbon-game-chat.c: Depending on the current situation, not all of 
  say, kibitz, and whisper are possible.
- activate/deactivate game chat entry according to situation.
- gibbon_session_handle_board() leaks memory, in case of failure.
- Remove old lines from beginning of text views in order to save memory.
- In the shout room, make TAB-expansion work on know user names.
- Write a GSettings mapping functions for hostnames that turns the entry
  into a canonical form.
- No need to send a "toggle" command after connect.  All toggles are sent
  by the server after login.
- Implement some sort of auto-idle that sets you to `not ready' after some
  time of inactivity.
- FIBS messages (** ...) should be displayed in a non-modal dialog.
- Check that the FIBS spanner bug as in "someplayer accepts the double. The 
  cube shows 2.13 anotherplayer Anybody for a 5 point match?" is also handled 
  correctly.
- IMPORTANT: If a saved match was an unlimited one, only optionally allow
  resuming it but display the normal match length selection.  Otherwise,
  both opponents have to wait until the match expires.
- Handle "wait for ... to join, too" and make sure that there is no deadlock if   both parties use Gibbon.
- Hash with saved games must be updated, when match finishes.
- Doubling cube not clickable, when not centered.
- Black bear-off goes to wrong side, when animated.
- When resuming a match, where we have turned the cube, the cube is not
  displayed.
- Segfault: Unlimited match, resumed, rejected recube from opponent with 
  right-click.
- Validate help pages with yelp-check.
- Build HTML version of help with yelp-build instead of gnome-doc-tool.
- Players list: The tooltip for the client icon is the one for the
  reliability.
