- beginning with glib 2.2, there is a GResolver object allowing asynchronous
  DNS, based on libasyncns for Unix and a native implementation for MS-DOS.
  Integrate it as soon as it is widely available.
- GibbonCairoboard should query a GibbonDesign for the values.
- Turn GtkBuilder xml file into a string constant instead of loading it
  at run-time.  Rationale: Too many run-time checks required otherwise.
- Change structure of match position.
- Set up a consistent convention for positive and negative checker
  numbers.
- Write a function that finds the player name for a selection.
- Implement a ping function to avoid timeouts.
- Change the constructor of gibbon_cairoboard to handle failure without
  warnings.
- Make libsvg work in locales with a decimal comma 
  (http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=292501)
- Implement patch from https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14773
- Do not return NULL from constructor of GibbonCairoboard in case the 
  constructor fails.
- Rewrite libsvg so that we can move and clone elements.
- Rewrite libsvg so that we can get the dimensions of every element.
- Glib 2.2 now has the GResolver API.  Use it!
- Review documentation for libgsgf.
- Are esacped in SGF files passed through?
- Prevent virgin GSGFProperty objects being serialized.
- Check that a node cannot contain the same property twice.
- Turn the higher level write_stream() functions into methods of a new
  interface.
- Dito for convert().
- Remove all traces of backgammon from gsgf.h.
- Let flavors give hints for compressing list of stones.
- Give ids to all documentation nodes so that file names are unique.
