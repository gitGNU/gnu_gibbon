- beginning with glib 2.2, there is a GResolver object allowing asynchronous
  DNS, based on libasyncns for Unix and a native implementation for MS-DOS.
  Integrate it as soon as it is widely available.
- Implement patch from https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14773
- Do not return NULL from constructor of GibbonCairoboard in case the 
  constructor fails.
- Are esacped values in SGF files passed through?
- Remove all traces of backgammon from gsgf.h.
- Better formatting of libgsgf output.
- Check that write_stream methods do not leak memory (pointer to
  temporary buffer must be freed, or alloca() must be used).
- Trade memory for performance: Avoid NULL pointers in gsgf-flavor.c.
- No need to check for single value in the new_from_raw constructors
  of libgsgf.  This is already done by the constraints.  Alternatively,
  gratuitous values could be discarded.
- Refactor set_value() method of GSGFText.  It must be possible to
  return an error.
- Remove the constructs if (*error) *error = NULL; fix caller instead.
- Make archive directory configurable.
- gsgf_node_get_property_cooked() must return a GSGFValue and should therefore
  be renamed.
- When setting the value of a GSGFProperty, that property must be
  automatically cooked.
- Decide on a philosophy for adding components in libgsgf.  Either always
  increase the reference count and leave the added object to the caller
  or always hijack the object.
- Go through gsgf-private.h and remove what is not needed.  Turn the rest
  into private class methods.
- Order header functions in libgsgf headers.
- GSGFSimpleText does not allow newlines.  Enforce that restriction.
  For example, gsgf_game_tree_set_application() must be changed
  accordingly.
- Check whether the player list context menu can be created with glade.
  Before 3.5.4 it was always converted to a GtkAction.
- Change svg-util.c to not switch locale.  Instead fix libsvg to
  use the g_ascii_strto...() functions from glib.
- Password gets lost if not saved in preferences.  Use a temporary
  buffer for it.
- Cancelling a connection attempt probably has a race.  The connector
  object gets unreffed before it can check its state.  FIX: Temporarily
  keep a reference.
- Get rid of GibbonSignal, it's pretty useless.
- gibbon-session.c leaks memory in case of board errors; pos must be freed!
- gibbon-game-chat.c: Depending on the current situation, not all of 
  say, kibitz, and whisper are possible.
- activate/deactivate game chat entry according to situation.
- gibbon_session_handle_board() leaks memory, in case of failure.
- Remove old lines from beginning of text views in order to save memory.
- In the shout room, make TAB-expansion work on know user names.
- Try to guess numerical IP from unresolvable host names.
