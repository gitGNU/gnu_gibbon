- beginning with glib 2.2, there is a GResolver object allowing asynchronous
  DNS, based on libasyncns for Unix and a native implementation for MS-DOS.
  Integrate it as soon as it is widely available.
- GibbonCairoboard should query a GibbonDesign for the values.
- Change structure of match position.
- Set up a consistent convention for positive and negative checker
  numbers.
- Write a function that finds the player name for a selection.
- Implement a ping function to avoid timeouts.
- Change the constructor of gibbon_cairoboard to handle failure without
  warnings.
- Implement patch from https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14773
- Do not return NULL from constructor of GibbonCairoboard in case the 
  constructor fails.
- Are esacped values in SGF files passed through?
- Remove all traces of backgammon from gsgf.h.
- Better formatting of libgsgf output.
- Check that write_stream methods do not leak memory (pointer to
  temporary buffer must be freed, or alloca() must be used).
- Trade memory for performance: Avoid NULL pointers in gsgf-flavor.c.
- No need to check for single value in the new_from_raw constructors
  of libgsgf.  This is already done by the constraints.  Alternatively,
  gratuitous values could be discarded.
- Refactor set_value() method of GSGFText.  It must be possible to
  return an error.
- Remove the constructs if (*error) *error = NULL; fix caller instead.
- Preserve original order of nodes, use a default order when creating
  missing default nodes.
- Make archive directory configurable.
- gsgf_node_get_property_cooked() must return a GSGFValue and should therefore
  be renamed.
- When setting the value of a GSGFProperty, that property must be
  automatically cooked.
- Decide on a philosophy for adding components in libgsgf.  Either always
  increase the reference count and leave the added object to the caller
  or always hijack the object.
- Go through gsgf-private.h and remove what is not needed.  Turn the rest
  into private class methods.
- Order header functions in libgsgf headers.
- Write a macro like g_return_val_if_fail that additionally sets a
  GError.
- GSGFSimpleText does not allow newlines.  Enforce that restriction.
  For example, gsgf_game_tree_set_application() must be changed
  accordingly.
