      The Simple Game Format (SGF) is a file format used by several
      board game applications for string matches, games, and positions,
      see <ulink url="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/">http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/</ulink>.
      The library libgsgf can be used to read and write such files,
      and modify the structure of such data.

      The library is currently part of
      <ulink url="http://guido-flohr.net/projects/gibbon">Gibbon</ulink>.
      If you want to use it in your own project you can simply copy
      the corresponding subdirectory into your own build structure.
      Alternatively, you can simply ask, and the library can be turned
      into a project of its own, and distributed as a shared library.
