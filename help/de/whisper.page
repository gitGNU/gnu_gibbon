  <title>Talking to Other Spectators (<cmd>whisper</cmd>)</title>
  <p>
    If you only want to talk to other people <link xref="watching">watching</link>
    the same game as you but not to the players themselves, you should
    “whisper”.  You can do this  by typing text into the
    <link xref="game-chat-area">game chat area</link> and
    only selecting the <gui style="button">whisper</gui>
    button.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will only work while you are <link xref="watching">watching</link>.
    If you are the only one watching a match, this feature is not
    particularly useful.
